## Z shell Config

- The configuration is for my MacOS machine.
- I try making this minimal and easy to roll out when using new machines
- Subsitute `ztnx` with the name of your machine.

### Plugins:

- zsh-autosuggestions
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- zsh-autopair

I don't use a plugin manager like OhMyZsh, <br />
I don't use many plugins, nor I want to regularly update them. <br />
`zsh_functions` has a good mini plugin manager
